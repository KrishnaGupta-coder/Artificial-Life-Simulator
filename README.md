# ðŸ§¬ Artificial Life Simulator in C (SDL2)

Welcome to the **Artificial Life Simulator** â€” a dynamic, real-time environment built entirely in **C with SDL2** where autonomous life forms evolve, seek food, reproduce, and compete for survival.

This isn't just a project â€” it's a living digital ecosystem that mimics evolutionary behavior through simple, elegant rules. Each entity behaves based on basic instincts, and what emerges is surprisingly lifelike and mesmerizing.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- ðŸ‘¾ **Autonomous Agents**  
  Life forms with unique speed traits and energy management, making decisions independently.

- ðŸŒ¿ **Food-Based Ecosystem**  
  Life survives by finding and consuming food scattered throughout the environment.

- ðŸ§¬ **Genetic Reproduction**  
  Life forms reproduce when they gain enough energy, passing down and mutating their speed traits.

- ðŸŒˆ **Color-Coded Visuals**  
  Each organism is drawn in a different color and shows its energy via visual bars.

- ðŸ§  **Basic Intelligence**  
  Life seeks out the nearest food source and adapts when none are available.

- ðŸŽ¨ **SDL2 Rendering**  
  Lightweight, efficient, and visually clear real-time graphics via the SDL2 library.
